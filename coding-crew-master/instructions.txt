Alright!


First let's download atom and git for windows


DO THESE ON YOUR OWN! Just google them!



Then, lets login to our github account!

For now, I am using Suvash's


Then, search for "coding-crew"

click on clone or download button

copy the link

now, open git

move into Desktop by typing cd Desktop
once there, type 
			git clone https://github.com/sardul3/coding-crew.git,
					the copied address
Since, I already have one, it didn't work!

LOL

Now, open the folder from atom

So, now you can edit the existing files, make changes and do whatever you want!

Lets make some changes!

After saving the file, move onto the lower right corner of atom!

click on the last icon that says 1 file, which means change has been detected 
in one of the files

click STAGE ALL

Then, include a commit message!

Something helpful. The message itself should make it clear what you changed in the project!

Watch and learn!

lol, again!

Press COMMIT

After that, there will be a number beside the arrows

Click on that icon

CLick PUSH

And, we are done!

Now, let's see what we just did!

The file is updated!



Move over to settings, scroll down to GITHUB PAGES

Click on the link!

And, there we go!


Now, everyone add their portion as soon as possible!

Thank you!


Peace out, hommies!
